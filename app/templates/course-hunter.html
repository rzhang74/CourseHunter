                <h4>What we do:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li class="body-content">Automatically tracking open spots for the courses of your choice.</li>
                    <li class="body-content">Sending you email notices about the availability of your chosen courses.</li>
                    <li class="body-content">Saving your time and energy trying to get into courses by checking manually. (Which is horrible. I've been there.)</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>What we don't do:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li class="body-content">Registering courses for you. (This kind of activity is not allowed by the University)</li>
                    <li class="body-content">Taking others' spots and give them to you. (This is bad and we simply cannot)</li>
                </ul>

                <p style="font-weight: 700;">Just register with your email address, set up a password, pick your classes and we will be watching for you! It's that simple!</p>
